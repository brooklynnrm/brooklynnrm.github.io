# Introduction

<img src="pics/oysters.jpeg" style="width:75%"/>

I am currently a Staff Associate at the Biomarkers Core Laboratory at the Columbia University Medical Center. Here, I work on exposomics projects to better understand the role of environmental exposures on human health. I specialize in Gas Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry to measure environmental contaminants. In addition to my work at the Core, I am a part-time student in the M.S. Environmental Health Data Science at the Mailman School of Public Health.
